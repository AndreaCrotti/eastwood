# Change log for Eastwood

## Changes from version 0.1.0 to 0.1.1

* Added consistency checking between namespace and file names before
  actual linting begins, to avoid hard-to-understand error messages
  that could otherwise result.  See [this
  section](https://github.com/jonase/eastwood/#check-consistency-of-namespace-and-file-names)
  in the docs.

* Added `:bad-arglists` linter.  See [this
  section](https://github.com/jonase/eastwood/#bad-arglists---Functionmacro-definitions-with-arg-vectors-differing-from-their-arglists-metadata)
  in the docs.

* No longer issue warnings for code inside of `comment` forms.  Fixes
  issue [#47](https://github.com/jonase/eastwood/issues/47)

* `lein help` now gives one-line description of Eastwood plugin, and
  `lein eastwood help` gives a link to the full documentation, and
  help about the same as that in the "Installation & Quick Usage"
  section.

* Reflection warnings appearing in output of `lein eastwood` should
  now be much closer to those produced by Clojure itself, and usually
  include useful line:column numbers.  There may still be some
  differences, so reflection warnings in the output of `lein check`
  are still the ones you want to trust, if there are any differences.

* Updates to track changes in `tools.analyzer` and
  `tools.analyzer.jvm` libraries.

* Top level `do` forms are now analyzed by Eastwood similarly to how
  Clojure itself does it, as if the forms inside the `do` were
  themselves independent top level forms.  See the article ["in which
  the perils of the gilardi scenario are
  overcome"](http://technomancy.us/143) for some description of why
  Clojure does this.  Fixes issue
  [#49](https://github.com/jonase/eastwood/issues/49)

* Correctly detect `gen-interface` forms even if invoked using
  `clojure.core/gen-interface`.

  to the commit.

* Updates to scripts and files used to test Eastwood, of interest only
  to Eastwood developers.
