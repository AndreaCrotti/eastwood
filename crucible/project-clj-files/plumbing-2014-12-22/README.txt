As of 2017-Oct-10, the latest version of the plumbing project gets
compilation errors from Clojure 1.9 spec failures.  I believe this is
because it is depending upon an older version of core.async with those
problems, but I am not highly motivated to track these issues down
right now.  Perhaps check back with the plumbing project later to see
if someone else gets it working with Clojure 1.9.
